"""
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA).

Approach: split text into clauses (on conjunctions like "but", "while",
"although", and sentence boundaries), detect which financial aspect each
clause is about via a keyword lexicon, then run the classical sentiment
model (sentiment.py) on that clause in isolation. This is a well
established, explainable ABSA pattern for small/no-training-data setups
(clause-level sentiment attribution) and is documented as such — it is
not a jointly-trained ABSA transformer, which is noted as a future
improvement in NLP_ARCHITECTURE.md.
