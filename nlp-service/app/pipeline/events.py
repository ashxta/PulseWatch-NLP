Financial event extraction.

Approach (explicitly NOT "ask an LLM and call it extraction"):
1. Trigger-word matching identifies the candidate EVENT TYPE (acquisition,
   merger, partnership, earnings_announcement, dividend, product_launch,
   leadership_change, layoffs, regulatory_action, funding, expansion).
2. NER (ner.py) supplies ORGANIZATION and MONEY entities from the same
   sentence.
3. Simple dependency-free heuristics assign ACTOR / TARGET roles: the
   organization nearest to (and before) the trigger verb is the actor;
   the next distinct organization after it is the target. This is a
   template/frame-based extractor, a standard classical IE technique,
   not a trained end-to-end model — documented as such.
4. The news classifier (classification.py) is cross-checked as a secondary
   signal; if it disagrees with the rule trigger, both are surfaced so the
   disagreement is visible rather than silently resolved.
