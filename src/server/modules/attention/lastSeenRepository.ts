// Concurrency note: two requests for the same (user, instrument) can
// interleave — e.g. a slow provider call for request A finishes after a
// faster one for request B that was issued moments later. A plain
// `upsert` would let whichever call happens to finish last win, even if
// its observation is actually older, silently moving the baseline
// backwards. To keep the baseline monotonic without any locking, the
// update is conditioned on this observation being at least as new as
// whatever is already stored; an older observation loses the race
// harmlessly instead of clobbering a newer baseline. This does not
// prevent two concurrent requests from both reading the same pre-update
// baseline and thus reporting the same "since last visit" delta once —
// that is an accepted, documented limitation (see DECISIONS.md), not a
// correctness bug: the baseline itself never regresses.
